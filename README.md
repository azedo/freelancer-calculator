# Freelancer Calculator

## Why?
### TL;DR
*`In summary, this is an app to manage your freelance projects.`* 

### Long Explanation
I've been a freelancer Frontend Developer for quite a while now, and one of my main issues was *how much should I charge my client?*.
Sure, they try to teach you the *howto's* in university, but we all know that when you are trying to get a new client, this is not the case.
Every client wants/needs/demands something different, so it's our job to try and supply the client with whatever the want in order to get that paycheck.

I built this app on top of an Excel table that a good friend of my once showed me when I asked him the same old dreadful question: *"How much should I charge my client?"*
He showed me how he did it, and told me that this method was working great for him, so I thought that I should give it a try.
After trying to find out a way of doing this for a while, I was very happy to realize that this was the perfect match for me!
I made my own tweaks to my friend's original table, but I got it working just like I wanted/needed.

The app's main purpose is to have an idea of how much you should charge a client based on the amount of hours you are going to dedicate to the project.
(Unfortunatelly) it's not magical... So you still need to have an idea of how much time you're going to spend on each project. The app is here just to help you with the math and to keep track on your monthly income and expenses.

## Todo
- Finish the profile page;
- Finish the settings page;
- Add internationalization;

## Roadmap
- Add a client section, where you can keep track of how many projects you did for each client, how much money they made you and also some basic information of them.
